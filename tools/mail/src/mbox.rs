//! The mbox reader: a store line, then each message in file order, read one at a time by
//! mail-parser's mbox iterator, so memory follows the message being read, not the file. A
//! message's id is its 1-based ordinal; no message has a folder. A message that fails the
//! header-shape check, or that mail-parser can't parse, gives a skipped line in its place, with a
//! warning, and the run goes on; a read that fails partway gives one for the message it was
//! reading, and ends there.
//!
//! The iterator reads mboxrd: a line quoted ">From ", ">>From " and so on loses one ">". An
//! mboxo is read the same way, so a body line that was ">From " to begin with loses its ">" too.
//! A message runs to the next line starting "From ", and mboxcl's Content-Length is not read, so
//! in an mboxcl or mboxcl2 an unquoted body line starting "From " starts a new message.
//!
//! With `--after <n>` the read resumes after message n: the iterator scans the separators of
//! messages 1 to n from the start of the file, parsing none of them, so none of their lines,
//! warnings or attachments are written, and the store line and the lines of the messages after n
//! follow, as a whole read writes them. An n past the file's last ordinal, empty entries counted,
//! is refused before any output.
